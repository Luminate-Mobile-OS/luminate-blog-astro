The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," covers about 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles) and spans nine South American countries. It is the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystem, containing an estimated 10% of the world's known species. This rainforest also plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change by absorbing and storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide. However, deforestation due to human activities poses a significant threat to the Amazon, leading to habitat loss and potential disruptions to global climate patterns.
